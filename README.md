# Description
**Tarkov Helper** is a Discord bot aimed to give users all kinds of information in an easy and read and use format. <br /> <br />
 - Since most players use Discord as a way to communicate, having a discord bot to access information within the game will help with having to open a browser and searching which will take more resources with the potential of lag in-game instead, now by typing in a command in a Discord server/channel, a simple alt-tab to an already open program will be much more efficient. Aswell as having extra useful features such as a **Bitcoin Farm Calculator**
 
 # Commands
 **The commmands for the bot include [Refer here to see responses](https://github.com/BetrixEdits/Tarkov-Helper/tree/master/Assets/Reponses)**
