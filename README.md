# Description
**Tarkov Helper** is a Discord bot aimed to give users all kinds of information in an easy and read and use format.
\n **-** Since most players use Discord as a way to communicate, having a discord bot to access information within the game will help with having to open a browser and searching which will take more resources with the potential of lag in-game instead, now by typing in a command in a Discord server/channel, a simple alt-tab to an already open program will be much more efficient. Aswell as having extra useful features such as a **Bitcoin Farm Calculator**

# Deployment
[**Click Here**](https://discord.com/oauth2/authorize?client_id=797600238449590334&scope=bot&permissions=511040) then **select a server** and hit **continue** to be able to add Tarkov Helper to your server.
