# Description (This Project Is Not Yet Finished)
**Tarkov Helper** is a Discord bot aimed to give users all kinds of information in an easy and read and use format. <br />

 - Tarkov Helper is using the new Discord Slash Command API so instead of using prefixs, just type `/` and a list of all valid commands will show. [Click Here](https://github.com/BetrixEdits/Tarkov-Helper/wiki/Commands) to see a more detailed explanation of all commands
 - Since most players use Discord as a way to communicate, having a discord bot to access information within the game will help with having to not open a browser and searching which will take more resources and time with the potential of lag in-game instead, now by typing in a command in a Discord server/channel, a simple alt-tab to an already open program will be much more efficient. Aswell as having extra useful features such as a **Bitcoin Farm Production Calculator** or a **Price Command**
 
 - Tarkov Helper is not associated with BattleState Games in any way 
 - Any use of Logos refering to Escape From Tarkov or in-game assets are owned by [BattleState Games](https://www.battlestategames.com)
