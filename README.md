# Description (This Project Is Not Yet Finished)
**SOME FEATURES ARE NOT COMPLETE**

**Tarkov Helper** is a fully featured Discord bot aimed at giving access to information in Escape From Tarkov in the easiest way

 - Tarkov Helper is using the new Discord Slash Command API so instead of using prefixs, just type `/` and a list of all valid commands will show. [Click Here](https://github.com/BetrixEdits/Tarkov-Helper/wiki/Commands) to see a more detailed explanation of all commands
 
 - Tarkov Helper is not associated with BattleState Games in any way. Any use of Logos refering to Escape From Tarkov or in-game assets are owned by [BattleState Games](https://www.battlestategames.com)
